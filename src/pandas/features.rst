 - A fast and efficient DataFrame object for data manipulation with
   integrated indexing;
 - Tools for reading and writing data between in-memory data structures and
   different formats: CSV and text files, Microsoft Excel, SQL databases,
   and the fast HDF5 format;
 - Intelligent data alignment and integrated handling of missing data: gain
   automatic label-based alignment in computations and easily manipulate
   messy data into an orderly form;
 - Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets;
 - Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large
   data sets;
 - Columns can be inserted and deleted from data structures for size
   mutability;
 - Aggregating or transforming data with a powerful group by engine allowing
   split-apply-combine operations on data sets;
 - High performance merging and joining of data sets;
 - Hierarchical axis indexing provides an intuitive way of working with
   high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional data structure;
 - Time series-functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion,
   moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions, date shifting
   and lagging. Even create domain-specific time offsets and join time series
   without losing data;
